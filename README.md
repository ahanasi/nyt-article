# nyt-article

This project was created as part of the Odin Project [curriculum](https://theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements). The goal was to replicate the layout of a New York Times article using positioning techniques such as Flexbox and Grid.
